# Point-of-Sale-console-App
This is a point of sale system that can be used as a sales app for malls and businesses. It has two privileges' for login: Admin and sales rep.  
I used vector container and a class to create a database for products and stores the database on a text file.
The software has different features like adding product, view avalable product, sale product etc.
These features are used by the sales rep and admin. 
The sales rep can only sale product why admin can add product, view available products and sale products.
